        <!-- The main purpose of your personal website is to show off your programming skills with your projects.
        You should include a portfolio section that displays your best and most recent work, with clear descriptions,
        screenshots, links, and testimonials. You should also include a blog section that demonstrates your knowledge,
        insights, and opinions on various programming topics, with relevant examples, code snippets, and resources.
        You can also add a resume section that highlights your education, experience, and achievements in programming.
